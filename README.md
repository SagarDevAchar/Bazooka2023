# Bazooka 2023 a.k.a. Jukebox 2023

A New Year Jukebox of user submitted songs across various languages and genres

## Why Jukebox 2023

Music is the single most beautiful thing which expresses the inexpressible. Music speaks a different language, the language of the soul. Although Music has no boundaries, we mortals create our own perimeter based on language, genre, region etc.

Jukebox 2023 was developed to break these barriers and expose people to a wider variety of music than their typical playlists. People have contributed their favourite music across a variety of genres and languages to build this website

Listen to a random song! 

Don't like it? There's plenty more to choose from!

But wait, even the choices are made anonymous so that you don't bias your decisions towards your current liking!
