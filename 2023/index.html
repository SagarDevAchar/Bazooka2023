                <h2>Why Jukebox 2023?</h2>
                <p>Music is the single most beautiful thing which expresses the inexpressible. Music speaks a different language, the language of the soul. Although Music has no boundaries, we mortals create our own perimeter based on language, genre, region etc.</p>
                <p>Jukebox 2023 was developed to break these barriers and expose people to a wider variety of music than their typical playlists. People have contributed their favourite music across a variety of genres and languages to build this website</p>
                <p>Listen to a random song! Don't like it? There's plenty more to choose from! But wait, even the choices are made anonymous so that you don't bias your decisions towards your current liking!</p>
